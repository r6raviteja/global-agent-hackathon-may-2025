Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am excited to apply for the Data Analyst position at Devsavant. With over five years of experience driving data-driven decisions and developing impactful BI solutions, I am eager to contribute to your mission of delivering high-quality insights for a leading subscription economy client. My background in managing complex data pipelines, ensuring data quality, and collaborating cross-functionally aligns well with Devsavant’s focus on accuracy, timeliness, and strategic decision support.  

During my current role at Allianz Partners, I developed and optimized ETL pipelines in SQL and Python, reducing manual reporting effort by 70%, which significantly improved reporting efficiency. Additionally, I built Power BI dashboards providing visibility across 119 business units, supporting strategic oversight of a $2.8 billion portfolio. At Rapido, I engineered scalable ETL workflows using PySpark and Presto, consolidating over 15 datasets into a master schema that cut dashboard load time from 15 minutes to just 30 seconds. These efforts directly improved data reliability, accessibility, and stakeholder trust—key aspects central to the Devsavant role.  

My experience also includes implementing QA processes, such as managing quality assurance dashboards in Redash and overseeing data validation procedures, ensuring consistent and reliable delivery of insights. I have worked extensively with SQL, Looker, Power BI, and other BI tools, empowering teams with accurate data for critical business decisions. This technical background, combined with my ability to collaborate at all levels—from product teams to executives—positions me well to support your clients' operational excellence.  

I am genuinely passionate about the subscription economy and the transformational potential of data analytics in this sector. The innovative environment at Devsavant, emphasizing growth, collaboration, and measurable results, strongly resonates with my professional values and ambitions. I look forward to the opportunity to bring my expertise in data quality, pipeline management, and stakeholder collaboration to your team.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how I can contribute to your team’s success and am available for an interview at your convenience. I look forward to your response.  

Sincerely,  
Raviteja R",,85.0,"The candidate has extensive experience with SQL, data analysis, BI tools, dashboards, and stakeholder collaboration, aligning well with the role's requirements. Slight gaps in explicit experience with some tools like LookML and Redash contribute to a slightly lower score, but overall qualifications are strong for the Devsavant Data Analyst position."

You create compelling visualizations and narratives. Collaboration & Influence: You build strong relationships and work effectively with cross-functional teams. You can translate business needs into analytical questions and influence decisions with data. Proactive & Curious: You don't wait for instructions; you proactively explore data, ask probing questions, and seek out opportunities to drive impact. You're eager to learn and apply new analytical techniques.

At Atlan, we believe the future belongs to the humans of data. From curing diseases to advancing space exploration, data teams are powering humanity's greatest achievements.

Data Scientist,Goodparty,USA,"Overview We are looking for a part-time (20-30 hours/week) data scientist or data analyst to contract with us on building internal reporting dashboards in Tableau for GoodParty.org , where our mission is to make people matter more than money in our democracy . This role is primarily focused on dashboard development and minor data transformation, supporting various teams across the organization. You will work with an existing data science contractor and collaborate with team leads as key stakeholders. This is a contract position for 4-6 weeks depending on start date, with the potential to extend. About GoodParty.org : GoodParty.org is empowering Independents to run, win, and serve so we can transform civic leadership. In 2024, we helped elect 3,444 Independent candidates into local offices across 48 states. Why? Americans – especially young people – have been losing faith in democracy. The rigged, two-party system has turned “Independent” into a dirty word. Voters are trapped between choosing the lesser of two evils or sitting out elections altogether. A majority of eligible voters (over 130M Americans), including more than half of Millennials and Gen Z, say that neither Republicans nor Democrats represent them. But they keep getting re-elected! Whether you’re concerned about healthcare costs, wars, the environment, our individual freedoms, or inequality, many great solutions are held back by the dark doom loop of dysfunctional partisan politics. While mainstream media and the two major parties focus on federal elections (Congress and the President), GoodParty.org is building from the bottom up. With over 500,000 elected offices in the United States—70% of which are uncontested—GoodParty.org is powering the movement to reclaim our communities from career politicians. We’re helping independents in local and state-level campaigns nationwide. Together, we’re building a truly representative democracy where society’s biggest problems are solved. How? GoodParty.org empowers independents to run, win, and serve in public office without the influence of partisan or big-money support. Through our free, AI-powered tools, we enable independent candidates to prioritize people over parties and community over corporate funding, transforming real people into civic heroes. We’re a platform, not a political party. And, it’s working! Starting with 11 wins in the 2023 election cycle, GoodParty.org set an audacious goal for 1,000 wins in 2024. We beat expectations – 3,444 candidates won this past November and are serving in office across 48 states! 40.3 million voters (26% of all 2024 voters) cast a ballot for our 6,317 candidates. Our general election win rate was 54.5%. Looking ahead, we’re building on our momentum and expanding our product offerings to help candidates deliver on their promises and serve their constituents effectively. Candidates who partner with us come from across the ideological spectrum and pledge to uphold people-powered principles, anti-corruption practices, and a commitment to civility. Together, we aim to transform civic leadership, bringing real accountability to public service and setting a new standard of leaders who prioritize the people they serve. GoodParty.org is founded by serial entrepreneur, Farhad Mohit , with over $1B in exits — Flipagram (now TikTok), Shopzilla, and BizRate. What you’ll do: Develop and refine internal-facing Tableau dashboards based on stakeholder requirements. Perform minor data transformations to ensure data is visualization-ready (may involve direct work in Databricks, PostgreSQL, or dbt). Assist with wireframing dashboard layouts and interpreting metrics. Collaborate with team leads and the data science contractor to align dashboards with organizational goals. Test and iterate on visualizations to optimize usability and insight delivery for cross-functional teams. Who you are: Strong expertise in Tableau, with a focus on building dashboards and applying data visualization best practices. 3+ years experience as a data analyst or data scientist. Experience with tools like Databricks, PostgreSQL, or dbt for light data transformation tasks. Familiarity with Figma, Balsamiq, or similar wireframing tools for designing dashboard layouts. Comfort with developing and refining internal Tableau dashboards based on stakeholder needs. Ability to thrive in a part-time contractor role, committing 20-30 hours per week for a minimum of 4 weeks, with potential for extension. Bonus if: You have familiarity with political/election reporting metrics You have worked at a data-driven startup You have experience studying, working, or volunteering in politics, political activism, or democracy reform You’re sick of sitting on the sidelines watching our democracy fail to meet its potential Why you should work at GoodParty.org : Join us in solving the biggest problem of our time – fixing our democracy – so all other problems can be solved. We’re a Public Benefit Corporation that prioritizes social impact over making money. Work where and how you like, on a fully remote team spread across the country. Join a passionate team with diverse political views focused on one mission. We’re fully funded for our mission. No stressing over whether the next round of funding will come through.
